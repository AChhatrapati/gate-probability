Let $X \in  \{1,2,...,100\}$ be the random variable representing the outcome for random selection of a number in $\{1,...,100\}$.

Since X has a uniform distribution, the probability mass function (pmf) is represented as 
\begin{align}
    \pr{X  = n} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{100} & 1  \le n \le 100 \\
        0 & otherwise
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
Let A represent the event that the number is divisible by 2.
Let B represent the event that the number is divisible by 3.
Let C represent the event that the number is divisible by 5.

We need to find the probability that the number is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5. Thus we need to find $1 - \pr{A+B+C}$

We know 
\begin{multline}
    \pr{A+B+C} = \pr{A} + \pr{B} + \pr{C} \\- \pr{AB} - \pr{BC} \\- \pr{AC} + \pr{ABC}\label{Shurururururururu}    
\end{multline}

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Event & Interpretation  & Probability  \\
\hline
A    & n is divisible by 2  & $\cfrac{50}{100}$ \\
B    & n is divisible by 3  & $\cfrac{33}{100}$ \\
C    & n is divisible by 5  & $\cfrac{20}{100}$ \\
AB   & n is divisible by 6  & $\cfrac{16}{100}$ \\
BC   & n is divisible by 15 & $\cfrac{6}{100}$ \\
AC   & n is divisible by 10 & $\cfrac{10}{100}$ \\
ABC  & n is divisible by 30 & $\cfrac{3}{100}$ \\

Substituting in \eqref{Shurururururururu}, we get
\begin{multline}
    \pr{A+B+C} = \frac{50}{100} + \frac{33}{100} + \frac{20}{100} \\- \frac{16}{100} - \frac{6}{100} - \frac{10}{100} + \frac{3}{100} 
\end{multline}
Thus, 
\begin{align}
    \pr{A+B+C} = \frac{74}{100}
\end{align}
Thus required probability = 
\begin{align}
    1 - \pr{A+B+C} = \frac{26}{100}
\end{align}

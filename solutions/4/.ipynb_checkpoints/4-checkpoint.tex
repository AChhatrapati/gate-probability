Let $X_{i} \in$ \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}, i=\{1,2,3\} be the random variables representing the outcome for each die. As the dice are fair the probability mass function (pmf) is expressed as 

\begin{align}
\tag{4.1}
    p_{X_{i}}(n)=\pr{X_{i}=n} =    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \frac{1}{6} & 1\leq n\leq 6 \\
      0 & otherwise \\
    \end{array} 
    \right. 
\end{align}

Let E be the event ``All the three dice have the same number of dots on the face showing''.



\begin{align}
    \tag{4.2}
    \pr{E} = \sum_{i=1}^{6}\pr{X_{1}=i,X_{2}=i,X_{3}=i}
\end{align}
As the events $X_{1}=i$,$X_{2}=i$ and $X_{3}=i$ are independent we have
\begin{align}
    \tag{4.3}
    \pr{X_{1}=i,X_{2}=i,X_{3}=i}=p_{X_{1}}(i).p_{X_{2}}(i).p_{X_{3}}(i)
\end{align}
    
\begin{align}
    \tag{4.4}
    \therefore \pr{E} = \sum_{i=1}^{6}p_{X_{1}}(i).p_{X_{2}}(i).p_{X_{3}}(i)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \tag{4.5}
    \implies \pr{E} = \sum_{i=1}^{6}\frac{1}{6}.\frac{1}{6}.\frac{1}{6}\\
    \tag{4.6}
    \implies \pr{E} = \frac{6}{216}\\
    \tag{4.7}
    \implies \pr{E} = 0.0277
\end{align}

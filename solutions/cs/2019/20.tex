The worst possible place, the pivot element can be placed is at extreme left or extreme right. So, there are only 2 worst possible locations. \\
\begin{equation}
   Pr (X1\ is\ compared\ to\ Xn) = \dfrac{2}{n}.
\end{equation}
Total number of pivot elements = 25. \\
Number of worst possible location of pivot element gets placed after first round of partitioning = 2. \\
Probability of placing pivot element in worst possible locations = $\dfrac{2}{25}$ = 0.08.

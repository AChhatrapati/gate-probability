Given question is a binomial distribution in which no of trails  $n= 4$.
\\Let's assume a trail is succeeded if the coin turns out to be head.Since it is a fair coin probability of success is $p=0.5$
\\Let $X$ be the binomial random variable of this distribution.
So $X \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$, 0 represents 0 heads, 1 represents 1 head, 2 represents 2 heads, 3 represents 3 heads and 4 represents 4 heads in 4 trails.
\\From binomial distribution,
\begin{align}
\Pr\brak{\textbf{X=r}}&=\comb{n}{r}p^{r}q^{n-r}
\\&=\comb{n}{r}p^{r}\brak{1-p}^{n-r}
\end{align}
Probability of getting two heads and two trails will be,
\begin{align}
\Pr\brak{\textbf{X=2}}&=\comb{4}{2}\times\brak{0.5}^{2}\times\brak{1-0.5}^{2}
   \\ &= 6\times\brak{\frac{1}{4}}\times\brak{\frac{1}{4}}
   \\ &=\frac{3}{8}
   \\ &=0.375
\end{align}
Hence,the required probability is $0.375$.

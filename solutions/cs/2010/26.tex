Let $X_i \in \cbrak{0,1}$ where $\pr{X_1 = 1}$ represents the computer is faulty before testing, $\pr{X_2 = 1}$ represents the testing process gives the correct result.
\begin{table}[h]

\caption{}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
           & $X_1 = 0$  & $X_1 = 1$\\
\hline
$X_2 = 0$  & (1-p)(1-q) & (1-q)p \\
\hline
$X_2 = 1$  &  (1-p)q    &  pq \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{cs2010-26:table:}
\end{table}
 
Table \ref{cs2010-26:table:} represents the probabilities of all possible cases.The probability of a computer being declared as faulty is 
\begin{align}
\tag{1.1}
     &= \pr{(X_2 = 1)(X_1 = 1)}+\pr{(X_2 = 0)(X_1 = 0)}\\
\tag{1.2}
     &= pq+(1-p)(1-q) 
\end{align}
The required option is (A).

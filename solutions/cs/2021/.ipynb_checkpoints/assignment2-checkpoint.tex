In our problem we have a binary channel which is not symmetric as crossover probabilities differ\\
Let $A \in \{0,1\}$ represent the random variable, where 0 represents H being transmitted, 1 represents L being transmitted. \\
Let $B \in \{0,1\}$ represent the random variable, where 0 represents H being received, 1 represents L being received. \\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\pr{A=0}}&0.1  &{\pr{A=1}}& 0.9  \\ \hline
\pr{B=0|A=0}&  0.3 &\pr{B=0|A=1}& 0.8 \\ \hline
{\pr{B=1|A=0}}& 0.7 &\pr{B=1|A=1}& 0.2  \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
}
\label{Tab:Tcr}
\end{table}
\\
Now we need to find \pr{A=0|B=0}\\
Using Bayes theorem
\begin{align}
\pr{A=0|B=0}=\frac{\pr{A=0}\times\pr{B=0|A=0}}{\sum_{i=0}^1 \pr{A=i} \times\pr{B=0|A=i}}
\end{align}
Putting in values given in question
\begin{align}
   \pr{A=0|B=0}=\frac{1}{25}=0.04 
\end{align}
The probability that transmitted signal was H is 0.04

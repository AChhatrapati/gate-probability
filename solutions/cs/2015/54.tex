We know, every $x \in X$ can be mapped to one of 20 elements in $Y$.
\begin{align}
    n(F) = 20 \times 20 = 400
\end{align}

For one to one functions,  the first element in $X$ has 20 elements it can be mapped to, and second element in $X$ has only 19 elements.(to avoid repetition).
\begin{align}
    n(f) = 20 \times 19 = 380
\end{align}
Required probability:
\begin{align}
    \frac{n(f)}{n(F)} = \frac{380}{400} = \frac{19}{20}
\end{align}

let $X_{0}$ be an event of raining today, $X_{1}$ be an event of raining tomorrow.  
Given that,
Probability that it will rain today
\begin{align}
\pr{X_{0}} = 0.5
\end{align}
Probability that it will rain tomorrow
\begin{align}
\pr{X_{1}} = 0.6
\end{align}
Probability that it will either today or tomorrow is 
\begin{align}
    \pr{X_{0} +X_{1}} =0.7
\end{align}
We have to find the probability that it will rain today and tomorrow which is
\begin{align}
\pr{X_{0}X_{1}}
\end{align}
we know that 
\begin{align}
\label{cs1997-1:eq}\pr{X_{0}X_{1}}= \pr{X_{0}} + \pr{X_{1}} - \pr{X_{0}+X_{1}}
\end{align}
On Substituting the values in \eqref{cs1997-1:eq}
\begin{align}
\pr{X_{0}X_{1}}= 0.5 + 0.6 - 0.7 = 0.4
\end{align}
So, therefore the probability that it will rain today and tomorrow is 0.4.

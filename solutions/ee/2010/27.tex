Let $X\in\{0,1\}$ be the random variable where X=0 represents that the first removed ball is white.
Let $Y\in\{0,1\}$ be the random variable, where Y=1 represents that the second removed ball is red. \\
After the first ball is removed (given to be white which means X=0), 
number of white balls reduces to 3 and total number of balls reduces to 6.\\
Probability that the second removed ball is red when the first removed ball is white is 
\begin{align}
 \pr{Y=1|X=0}= \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} 
\end{align}
So,
\begin{equation}
 \pr{Y=1|X=0} = 0.5
\end{equation}
$\therefore$ The answer is option (C) $\frac{1}{2}$.

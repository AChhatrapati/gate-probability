\section{Solution}
Let number of heads be $k$ , then number of tails are $n-k$.\\
Given : $|k-(n-k)|= n-3$\\
Case(i) \begin{align*}
    2k-n &= n-3 \\
    k &= n- \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}
As $k$ cannot be fractional, it's impossible.\\
Case(ii) \begin{align*}
    -(2k-n) &= n-3 \\
    k &= \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}
As $k$ cannot be fractional, it's impossible.\\
Thus, probability that the difference between number of heads and tails is $(n-3)$ is 0\\
Correct option is 2

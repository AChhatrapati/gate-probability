Let $X \in \{0,1\}$ be the random variable, where X=0 represents that we get sum to be 8 or 9 and X=1 represents that we get sum between 2 and 12 except 8 and 9.\\
Total number of possible outcomes is :
\begin{equation}
    N = {\comb{6}{1}}\times{\comb{6}{1}} = 36
\end{equation}
 
Probability that the sum is neither 8 or 9 
\begin{equation}\label{me2005-38:eq:2}
  \pr{X=1} = 1-\pr{X=0}
\end{equation}
 Only 9 outcomes are favourable to the occurrence of X=0 .\\
Probability of getting sum 8 or 9 is :
\begin{equation}
    \pr{X=0} = \frac{9}{36}
             = \frac{1}{4}
\end{equation}
Substituting value in \eqref{me2005-38:eq:2} , we get
\begin{equation}
 \pr{X=1} = 1- \frac{1}{4}
          = \frac{3}{4}   
\end{equation}
Hence, the correct option is (d) \large$\frac{3}{4}$

The probability of getting exactly 4 heads in the first 10 tosses can be calculated as
\begin{align}
    \pr{H=4,T=6}=\comb{10}{4} \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^4 \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^6
\end{align}
The probability of getting exactly 4 tails in the next 10 tosses can be calculated as
\begin{align}
    \pr{T=4,H=6}=\comb{10}{4} \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^4 \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^6
\end{align}
Since these two probabilities are independent of each other, the required probability is the product of these two
\begin{align}
    =\comb{10}{4} \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^4 \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^6 \times \comb{10}{4} \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^4 \times {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^6
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    =\frac{210^2}{2^{20}}=\frac{44100}{1048576}=0.042
\end{align}
So, the required probability is $0.042$.

Let $X\in\{0,1,2\}$ be the random variable such that X=0 represents that we draw 2 washers, X=1 represents that we draw 3 nuts and X=2 represents that we draw 4 bolts, continuously without replacement. \\
Total number of objects :
\begin{equation}
    N = 2+ 3+ 4 = 9
\end{equation}
Probability of occurrence of X=0 :
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=0} =& \dfrac{\comb{2}{2}}{\comb{9}{2}} \\
     =& \dfrac{1}{36}    
\end{align}
Total number of objects after occurrence of X=0 :
\begin{equation}
    N = 3+ 4 = 7
\end{equation}
Probability of occurrence of X=1 given that X=0 has already occurred :
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=1|X=0} =& \dfrac{\comb{3}{3}}{\comb{7}{3}}\\
   =& \dfrac{1}{35} 
\end{align}
Total number of objects after occurrence of X=0 and X=1 :
\begin{equation}
    N = 4 
\end{equation}
Probability of occurrence of X=2 given that X=0 and X=1 has already occurred :
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=2|(X=0,X=1)} =&\dfrac{\comb{4}{4}}{\comb{4}{4}} \\
     =& 1
\end{align}
Using Multiplication law of probability,\\ Required probability is given by :
\begin{multline}
    \pr{X=0 , X=1 , X=2} \\
      = \pr{X=0}\times \pr{X=1|X=0}\\\times \pr{X=2|(X=0,X=1)}
    \end{multline}
    
\begin{align}
\implies\pr{X=0 , X=1 , X=2} =& \frac{1}{36}\times\frac{1}{35}\times1 \\
=& \frac{1}{1260}
\end{align}
$\therefore$ The correct option is (C) \large $\frac{1}{1260}$.

Let A be the event that the student passes the exam and B be the event that the student gets above 90\% in the exam. Thus we need to find \pr{B|A}. We are given
\begin{align}
    \pr{A}  &= \cfrac{1}{5}\\
    \pr{AB} &= \cfrac{1}{20}
\end{align}
Thus required probability 
\begin{align}
    &= \pr{B|A}\\
    &= \cfrac{\pr{AB}}{\pr{A}}\\
    &= \cfrac{1}{4}    
\end{align}
Thus option B is the correct option.

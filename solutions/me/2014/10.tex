Let $X=0 $ if the batch is not accepted and $X=1 $ if it is accepted. \\
And let $Y=0 $ if the bulb is defective and $Y=1 $ if it is a non-defective.
\begin{align}
    \text{Total no. of bulbs } &= 100  \\
      \text{No. of non-defective bulbs }  &= 100 -5 \\
                                           &=95 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \Pr\brak{Y=1} &= \frac{95}{100} \\
                  & = \frac{19}{20}  \\
                  &= p
\end{align}
And let 
\begin{align}
    \Pr\brak{Y=0} &= \frac{1}{20} \\
    &= q = 1-p
\end{align}
We have to choose 4 non defective bulbs,
\begin{align}
    \Pr\brak{X=1} &= {4\choose 4} p^4 q^{4-4} \\
    &= \brak{\frac{19}{20}}^4 \\
    &= 0.814
\end{align}
Therefore, the probability that the current batch is accepted is $0.814 $.

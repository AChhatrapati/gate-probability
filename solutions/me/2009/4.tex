Let $X$ represent the number of heads obtained in a trial involving 3 tosses.\\
Then, X is a binomial random variable defined by: $X \sim B(n,p)$ where $n = 3$ and $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and:
\begin{align}
    \pr{X = k} = \comb{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align}
To find:
\begin{align}
    \pr{X\geq 1}\\
    =1 - \pr{X < 1}\\
    =1 - \pr{X = 0}\\
    =1 - \comb{3}{0}p^0(1-p)^3\\
    = \frac{7}{8}
    \end{align}

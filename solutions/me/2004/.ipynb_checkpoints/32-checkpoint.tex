Let $A,B \in \{0,1\}$, where $1$ denotes that card is a King, and $0$ denotes that card is not a King. $A$ denotes the first card is picked, $B$ denotes second card is picked.
\begin{align}
    \pr{A=1} &= \frac{4}{52}\\
    \pr{B=1|A=1} &=\frac{3}{51}
\end{align}
Applying Bayes Theorem, we need to find the value of $\pr{A=1,B=1}$:
\begin{align}
    &= \pr{B=1|A=1}\cdot \pr{A=1}\\
    &=\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{3}{51}\\
    &= \frac{1}{221}
\end{align}
The Probability that both cards are king is $\frac{1}{221}$, Hence \textbf{Option 4 }is correct

\begin{align*}
\text{Let } &E_1  &&\text{denote that he drops the needed key}\\
&E_2  &&\text{denote that he drops an unwanted key}\\
&A  &&\text{denote the event of opening the locks}
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
\pr{E_1} &= \frac{1}{3}\\
\pr{E_2} &= \frac{2}{3}\\
\pr{A|E_1} &= \frac{1}{5}\\
\pr{A|E_2} &= \frac{2}{5}
\end{align}\\
Hence by total probability rule,
\begin{align}
\pr{A} &= \pr{E_1}\times \pr{A|E_1} + \pr{E_2}\times \pr{A|E_2}\\
&= \frac{1}{3}\times\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{5}
\end{align}
Hence, the probability that the locks can be opened is $\frac{1}{3}$

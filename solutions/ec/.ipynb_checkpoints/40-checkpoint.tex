Let Y be the bit sent by the sender and X be the number of 1's received by the receiver and p = 0.1 is the crossover probability
\\
{Case 1: Y = 0}
\begin{align}
    \Pr(X = i) &= \binom{n}{i}\times p^i\times (1-p)^{n-i}
\end{align}
When $X \geq 2 $ the receiver interprets it as 1, which is an error. And by Total Probability theorem we have\\
\begin{align}
P_1 = \frac{P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)}{\sum_{i=0}^3P(X = i)}
\end{align}
where $P_1$ is the probability of error when Y = 0
\\
{Case 2: Y = 1}
\begin{align}
\Pr(X = i) &= \binom{n}{i}\times p^{n-i}\times (1-p)^i
\end{align}
When $X \leq 1 $ the receiver interprets it as 0, which is an error. And by Total Probability theorem we have
\begin{align}
P_2 = \frac{\Pr(X = 0) + \Pr(X = 1)}{\sum_{i=0}^3\Pr(X = i)}
\end{align}
where $P_2$ is the probability of error when Y = 1
\begin{multline}
\sum_{i=0}^3\Pr(X = i) = 1\times 0.9^3 + 3\times 0.1\times 0.9^2 \\
+ 3\times 0.1^2 \times 0.9 + 1\times 0.1^3 = 1
\end{multline}
\begin{align}
P_1 &= 0.028\\
P_2 &= 0.028
\end{align}
The average probability is 
\begin{multline}
P_{avg} = \Pr(Y = 0)\times P_1 +\Pr(Y = 1)\times P_2\\ = 0.028 \end{multline}

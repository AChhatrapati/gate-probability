Let A represent the event that P applies for the job. Let B represent the event that Q applies for the job. 

According to the given information in the question,
\begin{align}
\pr{A} = \frac{1}{4} \\
\pr{A|B} = \frac{1}{2} \\
\pr{B|A} = \frac{1}{3} 
\end{align}
According to the definition of Conditional Probability,
\begin{align}
\pr{A|B} = \frac{\pr{AB}}{\pr{B}} \label{2.0.4} \\
\pr{B|A} = \frac{\pr{AB}}{\pr{A}} \label{2.0.5}
\end{align}
On substituting the values of $\pr{A}$, $\pr{B|A}$ in \eqref{2.0.5}, we get
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{\pr{AB}}{\frac{1}{4}} \\
\pr{AB} = \left(\frac{1}{3} \right) \left(\frac{1}{4} \right) \\
\therefore \pr{AB} = \frac{1}{12}
\end{align}
Now substituting the values of $\pr{A|B}$, $\pr{AB}$ in \eqref{2.0.4}, we get
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{12}}{\pr{B}} \\
\pr{B} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{12} \right)}{\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)} \\
\therefore \pr{B} = \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
The probability that P does not apply for the job given that Q does not apply for the job is given by $\pr{A^{'}|B^{'}}$.

Now,
\begin{align}
A^{'}B^{'} = (A + B)^{'} \\
\Rightarrow \pr{A^{'}B^{'}} = \pr{(A + B)^{'}} \\
\therefore \pr{A^{'}B^{'}} = 1 - \pr{A + B} \label{2.0.14}
\end{align}
As we know that,
\begin{align}
\pr{A+B} = \pr{A} + \pr{B} - \pr{AB} \label{2.0.15}
\end{align}
By substituting the values of $\pr{A}$, $\pr{B}$, $\pr{AB}$ in \eqref{2.0.15}, we get
\begin{align}
\pr{A+B} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{12} \\
= \frac{3 + 2 - 1}{12} \\
\therefore \pr{A+B} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
$\therefore$ Required Probability is 
\begin{align}
\pr{A^{'}|B^{'}} = \frac{\pr{A^{'}B^{'}}}{\pr{B^{'}}} \label{2.0.19}   
\end{align}
By substituting the values of $\pr{B}$, $\pr{A^{'}B^{'}}$ [from \eqref{2.0.14}] in \eqref{2.0.19}, we get
\begin{align}
\pr{A^{'}|B^{'}} = \frac{1 - \pr{A + B}}{1 - \pr{B}} \\
\pr{A^{'}|B^{'}} = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{3} \right)}{1 - \left(\frac{1}{6} \right)} \\
\Rightarrow \pr{A^{'}|B^{'}} = \frac{\left(\frac{2}{3} \right)}{\left(\frac{5}{6} \right)} = \frac{4}{5}\\
\end{align}
$\therefore$ $\pr{A^{'}|B^{'}}$ = $\frac{4}{5}$ = 0.8

Hence, the probability that P does not apply for the job given that Q does not apply for the job is equal to $\frac{4}{5}$

$\therefore$ The correct option is (A) $\frac{4}{5}$ .

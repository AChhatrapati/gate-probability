Given PDF function is
\begin{align}
  P_{X}(x) &= \dfrac{1}{3\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\dfrac{-(x-4)^{2}}{18}}
\end{align}
Since continuous probability functions are defined for an infinite number of points over a continuous interval, the probability at a single point is always zero.
\begin{align}
    \pr{x} &=  \lim_{\delta\to 0} \int_{x}^{x+\delta} \dfrac{1}{3\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\dfrac{-(x-4)^{2}}{18}} \,dx\\
    &=0
\end{align}
Hence the probability is 0.

\item Consider a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with probability of error being p.To transit a bit, say 1,we transmit a sequence of three 1s.The receiver will interpret the received sequence to represent 1 if at least if at least two bits are 1.The probability that the transmitted bit will be received in error is

\item A digital communication system uses a repetition code for channel encoding/decoding. During transmission, each bit is repeated three times(0 is transmitted as 000, and 1 is transmitted as 111). It is assumed that the source puts out symbols independently and with equal probability. The decoder operates as follows: In a block of three received bits, if the number of zeros exceeds the number of ones, the decoder decides in favour of a 0, and if the number of ones exceeds the number of zeros, the decoder decides in favour of a 1. Assuming a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability p = 0.1, the average probability of error is ........

\item A sender(S) transmits a signal,which can be one of two kinds: H and L with probabilities 0.1 and 0.9 respectively, to a receiver (R).\\
In the graph below,the weight of an edge(u,v) is the probability of receiving v when u is transmitted,where u,v $\in$ \{H,L\}.For example the probability that the received signal is L given the transmitted signal is H is 0.7.

\item Consider a binary digital communication system with equally likely 0's and 1's. When binary 0 is transmitted the voltage at the detector input can lie between the level -0.25V and +0.25V with equal probability: when binary 1 is transmitted, the voltage at the detector can have any value between 0 and 1V with equal probability. If the detector has a threshold of 2.0V (i.e., if the received signal is greater than 0.2V, the bit is taken as 1), the average bit error probability is

\item Consider a discrete-time channel $Y = X+Z$, where the additive noise Z is signal-dependent. In particular, given the transmitted symbol $X \in \{-a,+a\}$ at any instant, the noise sample Z is chosen independently from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\beta X$ and unit variance. Assume a threshold detector with zero threshold at the receiver.\\
When $\beta = 0$, the BER was found to be $Q(a) = 1 \times {10^-8}$.\\
$$
\bigg(Q(v)= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{v}^{\infty} e^{\frac{-u^2}{2}}du$$, and for $v>1$, use $Q(v) \approx e^{\frac{-v^2}{2}} \bigg)$ \\
When $\beta = -0.3$, the BER is closet to

\item Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables such that $aX + bY$ is a normal random variable for all $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. Consider the following statements P,Q,R and S:


 (P): $X$ is a standard normal random variable.\\
 (Q): The conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y$ is normal.\\
 (R): The conditional distribution of $X$ given $X$ + $Y$ is normal.\\
 (S): $X$ - $Y$ has mean $0$.\\

\item A random variable $X$ takes values -1 and +1 with probabilities 0.2 and 0.8, respectively.
It is transmitted across a channel which adds noise $N$, so that the random variable at the
channel output is $Y = X + N$. The noise $N$ is independent of $X$, and is uniformly
distributed over the interval [-2 , 2]. The receiver makes a decision
\[
\hat{X} = \begin{cases}
            -1, &\text{if}\quad Y \leq \theta \\
             +1, &\text{if}\quad Y \geq \theta\\
            \end{cases}
\]
where the threshold $\theta  \in [-1,1]$ is chosen so as to minimize the probability of error
\pr {\hat{X} \neq X}. The minimum probability of error, rounded off to 1 decimal place, is \dots

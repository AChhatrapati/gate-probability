\item  Consider a single machine workstation to which jobs arrive according to a
Poisson distribution with a mean arrival rate of 12 jobs/hour. The process
time of the workstation is exponentially distributed with a mean of 4
minutes. The expected number of jobs at the workstation at any given
point of time is \ldots (\textit{round off to the nearest integer}).

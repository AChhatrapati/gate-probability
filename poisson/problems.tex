Poisson distribution with a mean arrival rate of 12 jobs/hour. The process

\item The number $N$ of persons getting injured in a bomb blast at a busy market place is a random variable having a Poisson Distribution with parameter $\lambda(\geq 1)$.
 A person injured in the explosion may either suffer a minor injury requiring first aid or suffer a major injury requiring hospitalisation. Let the number of persons with minor injury be $N_1$ and the conditional distribution of $N_1$ given N is
 \begin{align}
     \pr{N_1 = i \vert N} = \frac{1}{N}
     \label{condition}

  \item  Consider an amusement park where visitors are arriving according to a Poisson process with rate 1. Upon arrival, a visitor spends a random amount of time in the park and then departs. The time spent by the visitors is independent of one another, as well as of the arrival process and have common probability density function 
  \begin{align}
      f(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
          e^{-x}, & x > 0\\

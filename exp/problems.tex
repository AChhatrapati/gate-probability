 \item The time to failure, in months, of lights bulbs \\manufactured at two plants A and B
obey the exponential distributions with means 6 and 2 months respectively. Plant B produces
four times as many bulbs as plant A does. Bulbs from these two plants are indistinguishable.
They are mixed and sold together. Given that a bulb purchased at random is working after 12 months, What is the probability that it was manufactured in plant A?

\item Arrivals at a telephone booth are considered to be Poisson, with an average time of 10 minutes between successive arrivals.The length of a phone call is distributed exponentially with mean 3 minutes.The probability that an arrival does not have to wait before service is
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{0.3}
    \item{0.5}
    \item{0.7}

\item  Let Z be an exponential random variable with mean 1. That is, the cumulative distribution function of Z is given by 
\begin{align}
    F_Z(x) =
    \begin{cases}
    1 - {e^{-x}}, & if\ x \ge 0\\
    0, & if\ x<0.
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
Then Pr{(Z>2 | Z>1)}, rounded off to two decimal places, is equal to

\item The lifetime of a component of a certain type is a random variable whose probability density function is exponentially distributed with parameter 2. For a randomly picked component of this type, what is the probability that its lifetime exceeds the expected lifetime (rounded to 2 decimal places) ?
